# Website
Arabian group for business ordered to have a website for the company with a professional email address such as Name@domain.something while domain. Something is the company domain. 
What I have done:
- Bought the domain from go daddy 
- Add the domain in the costume domain section in github pages
- Made a show business account and added the emails with the domain I bought
- Added an SSL certificate using cloudflare
- Connected the Zoho with godaddy first
- Add the name servers got from cloudflare in godaddy DNS manager 
- Then I have connected the old domain they have (augfb.org) with the repo so both domains will open the same page

Results:
https://arabiangroup.net/
https://augfb.org/
